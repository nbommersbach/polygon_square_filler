# polygon_square_filler

Drawing Polygons in Python using Turtle is fun, but what if I wanted to fill a square with a polygon?
For an odd number of corners, the outer circle through the corners of that polygon will tuch the rectangle before any of the corners does.

This little program fixes this issue by detecting an odd number of corners and calculating the alternative side length.
